Description:
    Generates a fan-out worker that ensures the given queues, topics, and subscriptions are instantiated

Example:
    rails generate queue_worker WorkerName some_message_topic

    This will create:
        app/workers/<name>_worker.rb

    `topic` will be the message topic that the queue will listen to. 
    For example, `Messaging::Deliver.send("some_message_topic", 'stuff')` would send to topic `some_message_topic`
